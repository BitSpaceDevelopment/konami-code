# Konami Code

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code

The code was first used in the 1986 release of Gradius for the NES but was popularized among North American players in the NES version of Contra, for which it was also dubbed both the "Contra Code" and "30 Lives Code", because of its nearly necessary use in the game.

The Konami Code was created by Kazuhisa Hashimoto, who was developing the home port of the 1985 arcade game Gradius, a scrolling shooter released on the NES in 1986. Finding the game too difficult to play through during testing, he created a cheat code to give the player a full set of power-ups (normally attained gradually throughout the game). The code was still present in the released Gradius after Hashimoto forgot to remove it. Players discovered and shared the code via word of mouth.

## Usage

You can pass in a function, JS, or a URL to launch from the cheat code.

```javascript
var cheat = new Konami('http://bitspacedevelopment.com');
```	
	
OR:

```javascript
var cheat = new Konami(function() { alert('Cheater')});
```
